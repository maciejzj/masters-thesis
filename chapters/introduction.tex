\section{Super--resolution technology}
Super--resolution is a~group of techniques that upscale images and improve
their quality.
Such an algorithm can be treated as a function that takes an image and returns
it with a resolution \textit{n} times larger.
Algorithms taken into account in the process usually upscale images two or
four times.
In this study, due to the size of the available satellite images, the ratio of three was used.

It is important to distinguish between super--resolution and traditional
upscaling algorithms.
The latter use interpolation to enlarge images; however, they hardly improve the
quality of the image.
The intent of super--resolution is not only to upscale images, but to improve
the quality and detailing.
Nowadays, such an effect is achieved using machine learning, precisely---deep
learning---a technology that utilizes multi-layered neural networks trained
with large datasets.
Deep learning networks that process image data usually utilize convolutional
layers.
Such layers contain a number of image filters whose weights are tuned during training.
Like all the rest of machine learning algorithms, the deep learning based
super-resolution works in a statistical manner.
This means that the extra details created during the image enhancement process
state an imaginary approximation of image features.
It is important to keep the statistical nature of machine learning algorithms
in mind.

Two main kinds of super--resolution algorithms can be outlined:
\textit{one-to-one} and \textit{many-to-one}.
The first one is the obvious approach, where one low-resolution image is
translated into a high-resolution one.
The first technique is often called \textit{single-image super-resolution} and the latter \textit{multi-image super-resolution}.

Super-resolution imaging is a technique relevant in the fields of satellite imaging
remote sensing and geoscience.
The most common reason for image enhancement is for aesthetic reasons.
This application is viable in satellite imaging; however, super--resolution can
lead to other practical advantages.
Image enhancing techniques can be used as a preprocessing step in remote
sensing pipelines.
For this reason super-resolution can be especially useful when considered in
the context of satellite imagery.
A visual demonstration of modern super-resolution applied on satellite images can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:super-res-fields-demo} and \ref{fig:super-res-dots-demo}.
In these examples a set of nine low--resolution images per each scene was super--resolved into a single high--resolution one.
A sample of those nine images is shown in the comparison.

\section{Purpose of data augmentation and available solutions}
\label{sec:augmentation-introduction}
\textit{Data augmentation} is a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of datasets used for training machine learning models \cite{perez-2017-augmentation}.
Deep learning, utilized in the modern super--resolution techniques, requires a
lot of data to train successfully.
Increase in quality and size of a dataset can lead to far better results when
training a neural network.
This is why data augmentation techniques are often used to improve performance
of deep networks.
Data augmentation incorporates various transformation to improve, multiply or
generate training data.
This process often multiplies data by modifying existing examples; however, more advanced generation techniques can produce fully artificial datasets.
Completely new data created in the augmentation process is often called \textit{synthetic} \cite{nikolenko-2021-synthetic}.
Classical augmentation techniques utilize simple operations like image resizing, flipping, mirroring, recoloring, etc.
However, more advanced approach can be taken to generate data.
It is possible to train deep neural networks to perform data augmentation
transformations.
This approach can be especially useful when a dataset is available that it is
too small to train the desired network.
The small dataset can be used to fit a simpler network that is taught to create new data, based on the existing training set.
Then, this small augmentation network can be used to generate more data for the
original model to learn.
With deep learning capabilities networks can learn to multiply, transform or
even generate data without direct input.

\section{Aim of the work and motivation}
The objective of this work is to create a set of augmentation networks for
enhancing super--resolution training data.
Subsequent chapters will present considered super--resolution architectures
with more details and propose neural network models for data augmentation.
The task of the augmentation algorithms is to create low--resolution images for
high--resolution ones, to make training pairs for super--resolution networks. 

The nature of super--resolution technology and satellite imagery imposes certain
ways in which data augmentation should be applied to the training data.
Single image super--resolution is trained using pairs of high and low-resolution images.
On the other hand, multi-image super-resolution learns from examples of one high-resolution image bounded with multiple low-resolution ones.
These requirements render compiling training sets a challenge, especially in the
field of satellite imagery.
Despite the fact that single satellite images are widely available, it is difficult to find collections containing pairs of the same scenes with different resolutions

Data augmentation and generation techniques may be the solution to the scarcity of the satellite data suitable for super-resolution trainings.
Pairs of high and low-resolution images can be created from single-image satellite datasets by resizing existing photographs.
A set of training pairs can be created by downscaling high--resolution images.
In the case of many--to--one networks, a single high--resolution image can be
multiplied and shifted before shrinking to create more low--resolution images.
Such a technique may work well; however, it infuses the data with information
about resizing algorithms.
The way high--resolution and low--resolution images relate in such a set
depends on the interpolation algorithm (e.g., bicubic, bilinear,
nearest, Lanczos).
The network trained on alike datasets will likely learn to invert given
interpolation methods.
This does not match exactly real--life scenarios, most images are not created
using resizing algorithms.

However, another method of data augmentation based on deep learning is possible.
Similarly to the super-resolution it requires pairs of real low and high--resolution
images of the same scene, taken by cameras of different quality.
The main idea of this project is to use a dataset of real--life data to
train an augmentation network.
Such a network would learn to create low--resolution images for
high--resolution, without imprinting resampling algorithms mechanisms into the
data.
The relation between low and high--resolution images in this augmented
dataset would resemble the relation between same image taken by cameras of
different quality.
The deep learning approach to data augmentation has proven beneficial in other fields of super-resolution imaging \cite{bulat-2018-supergan}.

The augmentation neural network can be then used on other satellite image
datasets to generate training data pairs for super--resolution.
Different data, models and generation techniques can be used to achieve desired
results.
Possible variations are discussed in the course of this work to improve
super--resolution datasets.
For clarity, the different methods of data augmentation are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:augmentation-resize} and \ref{fig:augmentation-deep-learn}.
