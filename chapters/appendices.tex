\chapter{Model and training parameters of the augmentation networks}
\label{ch:appendix-params}
As stated in the work the models and training process are parametrized by set o variables in a \textit{params.yaml} file.
This file is supervised by Git and Dvc to ensure reproducibility and artifacts caching.
Contents of the configuration file during the training of augmentation networks are presented in the listing \ref{lst:params-file}.
