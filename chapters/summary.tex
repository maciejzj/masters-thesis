In the course of the work various approaches to data augmentation were explored.
Three different deep learning architectures were introduced and compared with the traditional approach.
The augmentation networks were trained on real--life data and used to export new datasets to fit the super--resolution algorithm.
Then the super--resolution models were evaluated on various synthetic and real--file images; both in a numerical and visual way.
The cross--validation based approach to training supervision confirmed to be valuable.
The deep learning based--methods proved to be of utility, yet slightly below what would be expected since they didn't surpass the bicubic interpolation approach.
There may be a variety of reasons for that to explore.
Many possibilities were not explored in a full way; translations between low--resolution images may be investigated in a greater detail.
Modeling them after distribution extracted from a real--world dataset may lead to enhanced results.
The semi--simulated approach for data generation was not included in the scope of the work; however, it would be interesting to investigate this option in the future.
Since the generalization capabilities remain an issue, more emphasis may be put on regularization.
Adding more noise to augmented images may lead to less overfitting and artifacts generation.

The observations connected with the cross--validation approach are worth being noticed.
Early stopping training based on this approach leads to slightly better results compared to normal trainings.
This indicates a greater overfitting problem in regard to the data generation method.
The robust data augmentation problem remains open, however valuable observations about the issue of super--resolution generalization has been made.

There is a value in the opportunity for further development of the work and more detailed investigation.
Achieving robustness and greater generalization of super--resolution techniques through better data augmentation is an important step towards productization of this technique.
A super--resolution algorithm independent of satellite data type would be useful in the image  processing pipeline during aerospace missions, remote sensing tasks and Earth observations.
