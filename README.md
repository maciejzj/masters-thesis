Data augmentation for super-resolution reconstruction using deep 
convolutional neural networks
================================================================

My bachelor's thesis covering the topic of data generation and augmentation for
super-resolution images. The work includes training convolutional neural
networks for image degradation. The degradation networks are used for creating
image pairs for super-resolution training.  Various data creation methods are
applied and compared in the work.

Feel free to check out the 
[project repository](https://github.com/maciejzj/cnn-res-degrader), to examine 
the implementation.  The work was continued at [KP Labs](https://kplabs.space)
after I finished my degree, so the thesis may become outdated.
