\begin{abstract}
The aim of this work is to enhance super--resolution satellite imaging by using
data augmentation techniques based on deep learning algorithms.
Super--resolution is a technology that enables upscaling images to a higher
resolution with more refined details and improved quality.
Such image--enhancing techniques are nowadays undergoing rapid development
thanks to advancements in deep learning and convolutional neural networks.
Deep learning is an approach in which training data plays a key role in the
outcome and quality of the solution.
Size and quality of the dataset used to train super--resolution networks are
crucial to achieve best results.
This is especially significant when working with satellite images, which are
effortful to acquire in large numbers.
Thus, when training a super--resolution network, it may be worth incorporating
data augmentation techniques.
Data augmentation is a process that intends to enlarge and improve training
datasets for machine learning by transforming, multiplying or generating data.
This process has been traditionally done using trivial techniques, however this
work aims to use deep learning to generate datasets for training
super--resolution algorithms.
Following chapters provide an overview of modern super--resolution solutions
and a proposal of deep learning algorithms to enhance the training datasets.
Results of the work are evaluated by testing super--resolution networks which
were trained on the datasets created during the project.
